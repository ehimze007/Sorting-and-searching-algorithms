# Sorting-and-searching-algorithms

- Loop through the array and compare each element to its left.
- The outer loop starts at the second element and goes to the end of the array.
- The inner loop starts at the current element and goes backwards to the beginning of the array, comparing each element to the current value.
- If the current value is less than the compared value, we swap their positions.
- Finally, we return the sorted array.
